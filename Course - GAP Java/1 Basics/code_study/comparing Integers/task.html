<h1>comparing integers</h1>
We've learned that in order to compare object, in Java we can use:
<ul>
  <li>== for comparing references</li>
  <li>.equals(...) for comparing values</li>
</ul>
<br>
But if we apply this newly learned techniques for comparing integers, we can get mixed results.
<br>
Can you explain why we get different results if we compare 127 with 127 then when we compare 128 with 128 ?
<div class="hint">
  Numbers from -128 to 127 are cached in the JVM
