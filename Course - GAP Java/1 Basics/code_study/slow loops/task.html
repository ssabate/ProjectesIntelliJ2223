<h1>slow loops</h1>
Why are some loops faster/slower then others ?
<br>
Why do we get different loop speeds between loopUsingPrimitive() and loopUsingWrapper() ?
<br>
<div class="hint">
  loopUsingWrapper() will take longer because Integer will be allocated in heap and needs to be garbage collected.
